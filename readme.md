# React-Noteapp

This is my take on a 'note taking' app made with ReactJS. Notes are saved to local storage.

Notes creation require Note Title name, body is optional. Notes can be reordered and deleted.

## Future planned features

- **Very** basic key-pass system to sync notes online
- Editable note content
- Allow alternate between list view and block view
